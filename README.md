# ❤️ LittleLink is running phjl.de

## 📋 Different Variants

As I am running very similar sites on philipp-kirchner.de and phjl.de, just with a different focus on persona, each of these gets their own repository.

🤓 https://phjl.de is my personal site, focussed on the human I am outside of my job. 
👔 https://philipp-kirchner.de is focussed more on a professional apperance, with the ability to connect on "businessy" social media, aquire my CV, etc.


## 🧰 Deployment

There is currenty no automated depolyment process, I just clone the repo onto the web server where it is then served by nginx for the relevant domain. As you can easily figure out, both of the links above are served by the same web server, I call it 'stargazer'.


## ⚙️ Littlelink

Instead of writing everything by hand (I have done that before, feel free to check it out!) I use the fantastic LittleLink to easily set up a neat and uniform look for my websites.
